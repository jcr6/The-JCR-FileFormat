JCR6 file format
================


This is only a quick description of how a JCR6 file is set up.
Please note, this document was set up on February 7, 2021, and some changes may have taken place later. 
As long as the changes keep the existing JCR6 libraries backwards compatible I will keep calling it JCR6.
If this is no longer possible I will likely start up JCR7.


Terms
=====
int - In JCR6 that is always a signed 32-bit integer in LITTLE Endian
byte - a signed 8-bit integer
string - a series of bytes and in JCR6 always prefixed with an int telling JCR6 how many bytes fit in the string.

JCR6 has NO support for non-ASCII characters in its own strings. Never forget that.
